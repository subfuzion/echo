echo
----

A Node.js Express web application that hosts an [echo.io](https://github.com/tonypujals/echo.io) WebSocket server.

The UI allows users to start and stop the the WebSocket server on a specified port. The UI supports sending and receiving messages, but any WebSocket client can communicate with the server once it has been started.
